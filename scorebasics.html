						<a class="apro1">
					There are 4 major factors that affect your score:<br> 
						1.Payment history<br>
						2.Making late payments or defaulting your EMIs or Dues Will negatively affect your score.<br>
						3.High utilization of Credit Limit While increased spending on your credit card will not <br>necessarily affect your score in a negative manner.<br>
						4.Higher percentage of credit cards or personal loans (also known as unsecured loan).<br>Having a balanced mix between the secured loans (such as Auto, Home loan) and unsecured loan<br> (such as Personal loan, Credit Card) is likely to have a more positive affect on your score.<br>
						5.Many new accounts opened recently If you have recently been sanctioned multiple loans<br> and credit cards, then lenders will view your application with caution because this behavior<br> indicates your debt burden has increased increase, which will negatively impact your score.<br>
